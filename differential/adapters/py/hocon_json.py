"""py.hocon adapter for the cross-impl differential harness (xx.hocon/generate).

Parses + resolves a HOCON file and prints the resolved tree as canonical JSON to
stdout. On any parse/resolve error it prints a single-line
``{"__error__":{"type":..,"message":..}}`` record to stdout and exits 3, so the
differential driver can compare error-vs-success behaviour uniformly across the
go / rs / ts / py adapters and the Lightbend oracle.

Usage: ``python tools/hocon_json.py <conf-file>``

Output is produced by ``Config._render_json_for_test`` — the same canonical
renderer the conformance harness validates against the Lightbend-generated
expected JSON, so the adapter's success output is oracle-aligned by construction.
Unlike rs.hocon's renderer, py's escapes object keys (``json.dumps(k)``), so no
serde-style rebuild is needed — this mirrors ts.hocon's ``_renderJSONForTest``
adapter.

Environment substitutions resolve against the process environment; the
differential driver controls hermeticity by clearing / setting the subprocess
env, so this adapter deliberately does NOT force ``env={}`` (that would break the
env-substitution corpus cases the driver sets variables for).
