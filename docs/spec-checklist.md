# HOCON Spec Compliance Checklist — Template

Canonical item definitions for the [Lightbend HOCON specification](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/main/HOCON.md), shared across the three implementations:

- [o3co/ts.hocon](https://github.com/o3co/ts.hocon)
- [o3co/rs.hocon](https://github.com/o3co/rs.hocon)
- [o3co/go.hocon](https://github.com/o3co/go.hocon)

## Role of this file

This file defines **what** to check (the items + spec references). It does NOT record which implementation passes which item. Each implementation maintains its own compliance file (`docs/spec-compliance.md`) that inherits these items and fills in status, test locations, and notes.

The cross-implementation roll-up lives at `xx.hocon/docs/compliance-matrix.md` (generated from the per-repo files).

## Item format

```text
- **<ID>** <short description> — §<HOCON.md section> (L<line range>)
  [out-of-scope: <reason>]   ← optional, included only when all 3 impls treat the item as out-of-scope
```

Per-repo files extend each item with `tests:` and `status:` fields.

## Status legend (used in per-repo files)

| Glyph | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Test exists and passes |
| ⚠️ | Test exists, partial pass / known-incorrect-but-pinned |
| ❌ | Test exists and fails (or known spec violation) |
| 🤷 | No test — implementation claim only, unverified |
| ➖ | Out of scope (rationale required) |

## Compliance rate convention

**Denominator = all items, including ➖.** Out-of-scope items lower the rate. This is intentional: the rate must not be massaged upward by reclassifying gaps as "not applicable". Each ➖ requires an explicit rationale so the reader can judge whether the exclusion is principled.

In per-repo rollups, surface both:

- *Spec-total rate*: `(✅ + ⚠️·0.5) / total`
- *In-scope rate*: `(✅ + ⚠️·0.5) / (total − ➖)` (report `N/A` if `total − ➖ = 0`)

`❌` and `🤷` contribute `0` in both formulas. `🤷` is treated the same as `❌` for rate purposes because an unverified claim is, by policy, not a pass — pinning it as ✅/❌ requires a test.

The two numbers, side by side, neutralize "we look bad because we don't do classpath" objections without hiding the gap.

## Maintenance

1. New normative behavior in HOCON.md → add an item here in xx.hocon, then sync into each per-repo file.
2. Each per-repo file imports the item set verbatim and only edits its own `tests:` / `status:` cells.
3. Drift check: a CI step (or pre-PR script) verifies per-repo files cover every ID in this template, with no extra IDs.

## S1. Unchanged from JSON

- **S1.1** Files must be valid UTF-8 — §Unchanged from JSON (L117)
- **S1.2.1** Quoted strings accept valid JSON escape sequences (`\" \\ \/ \b \f \n \r \t`) — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
- **S1.2.2** Unknown / invalid escape sequence (e.g. `\q`, `\x`) is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
- **S1.2.3** Malformed `\uXXXX` (short / non-hex) is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
- **S1.2.4** Unescaped control char / raw newline in quoted string is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
- **S1.2.5** Unterminated quoted string is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
- **S1.2.6** Unpaired UTF-16 surrogate codepoint in `\uXXXX` escape — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  out-of-scope: intentional language-natural divergence. Java (Lightbend reference) silently accepts unpaired surrogates because Java strings are 16-bit code-unit sequences; Rust `char` and Go `rune` cannot represent them and reject. xx.hocon conformance fixtures cannot cover this case (the Java generator fails to encode unpaired surrogates as UTF-8 when writing expected JSON). Each implementation follows its language's string-type constraints. Documented in xx.hocon commit 86bd82e.
- **S1.3** Value types: string, number, object, array, boolean, null — §Unchanged from JSON (L119)

- **S14a.3** `include file("...")` — §Include syntax (L927)
- **S14a.4** `include classpath("...")` — §Include syntax (L927)

### S14f. Include semantics: locating resources

- **S14f.1** Quoted-string heuristic: URL if valid protocol — §Include semantics: locating (L1115)
  out-of-scope: URL include unsupported; see S14a.2. The heuristic that distinguishes URL strings from filenames is moot when no URL form is supported.
- **S14f.2** Otherwise treated as file/resource adjacent to including — §Include semantics: locating (L1117)
- **S14f.3** Filesystem: relative path = relative to including dir (NOT cwd) — §Include semantics: locating (L1154)

## S16. MIME Type

- **S16.1** Content-Type for HOCON resources is `application/hocon` — §MIME Type (L1223)

- **S17.7** object → other type: error — §Automatic type conversions (L1254)
- **S17.8** array → other (except numeric-indexed): error — §Automatic type conversions (L1255)

## S18. Units format

- **S18.1** Number value taken as default unit — §Units format (L1279)

- **S18.3** Unit name letters-only (Unicode L* / `isLetter`) — §Units format (L1287)
- **S18.4** String with no unit → interpreted with default unit — §Units format (L1290)

## S20. Period format

- **S20.1** `d` / `day` / `days` — §Period Format (L1327)
  out-of-scope: Period Format mirrors `java.time.Period`, a JVM-specific type; the spec text (L1316-1318) explicitly references this Java API. None of the three implementations exposes a period parser/API.
- **S20.2** `w` / `week` / `weeks` — §Period Format (L1328)
  out-of-scope: Period Format unsupported; see S20.1.

## S22. Config object merging API

- **S22.1** `merge(A, B)` semantics = duplicate-key behavior — §Config object merging (L1402)
- **S22.2** Intermediate non-object hides earlier object across files — §Config object merging (L1406)
- **S22.3** Setting key to null clears earlier object value — §Config object merging (L1436)

## S23. Java properties mapping

- **S23.1** Split key on `.` preserving empty strings — §Java properties (L1450)
- **S23.2** Empty path elements (leading/trailing) preserved — §Java properties (L1456)
- **S23.3** Properties values are always strings — §Java properties (L1471)
- **S23.4** Object wins over string on conflicting key — §Java properties (L1485)
- **S23.5** Multi-line values (backslash continuation) — §Note on Java properties similarity (L1587)
  out-of-scope: declared in each implementation's README — the `.properties` reader supports only basic `key=value` syntax to avoid pulling a full Java properties parser into a non-JVM library.
- **S23.6** Unicode escapes in `.properties` — §Note on Java properties similarity (L1587)
  out-of-scope: same rationale as S23.5.

## S24. Conventional config files (JVM)

- **S24.1** `reference.conf` classpath merge — §Conventional configuration files (L1502)
  out-of-scope: relies on classpath resource resolution (see S14a.4).
- **S24.2** `application.{conf,json,properties}` default load — §Conventional configuration files (L1506)
  out-of-scope: relies on classpath resource resolution (see S14a.4).

## S25. System property override

- **S25.1** System properties override config file values — §Conventional override (L1530)
  out-of-scope: JVM system properties are a JVM-only mechanism; non-JVM runtimes use environment variables or library-specific overrides.

## S26. Substitution fallback to environment variables

- **S26.1** Env var lookup when substitution not in config tree — §Substitution fallback (L1536)
- **S26.2** Empty env var preserved as empty string (not undefined) — §Substitution fallback (L1558)
- **S26.3** Env var SecurityException → treated as not present — §Substitution fallback (L1560)
  out-of-scope: `SecurityException` is a JVM-specific exception type; non-JVM runtimes have no equivalent guard at this layer.
- **S26.4** Env vars always become strings (with auto type conversion) — §Substitution fallback (L1563)

## Notes

- The HOCON.md "Goals / Background" (§L59), "Definitions" (§L92), "hyphen-separated vs. camelCase" (§L1567), and "Note on Windows and case sensitivity" (§L1598) sections are narrative, advisory, or platform-specific. They are intentionally not represented as binary check items here. (The "Note on Java properties similarity" §L1572 is partially represented via S23.5–S23.6.)
- Surrogate-codepoint handling (a known Rust/Java divergence) is not yet a checklist item. Decide where it belongs (under S1 or S9) once the resolution is settled.
